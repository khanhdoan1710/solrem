# SolREM App Strategic Transformation - Planning Document

## Background and Motivation

The user has made a strategic shift in the SolREM app concept. The new vision transforms SolREM from a simple sleep tracking app into a comprehensive sleep ecosystem with the following key components:

1. **Mobile-Only Sleep Tracking App**: Focus on mobile experience with data integration from multiple wearable devices
2. **Multi-Device Sleep Data Integration**: Starting with Garmin, expanding to CUDIS and Whoop
3. **Research-Based Sleep Scoring**: Implement sleep scoring algorithm based on multiple research studies
4. **Resources Tab**: Aggregate sleep improvement content (threads, videos, research)
5. **Permissionless Prediction Market**: Revolutionary feature allowing users to create and bet on sleep prediction markets

This represents a significant pivot from the current basic sleep tracking implementation to a sophisticated platform combining health data, social features, and prediction markets.

## Key Challenges and Analysis

### Technical Challenges:
1. **Data Integration Complexity**: Integrating with multiple wearable APIs (Garmin, CUDIS, Whoop) requires different authentication flows and data formats
2. **Sleep Scoring Algorithm**: Need to research and implement scientifically-backed sleep scoring formulas
3. **Prediction Market Infrastructure**: This is the most complex feature - requires:
   - Smart contract development (likely Solana-based given the name "SolREM")
   - User wallet integration
   - Market creation and management system
   - Betting mechanism with escrow
   - Oracle integration for sleep data verification
4. **Mobile-First Architecture**: Ensure all features work seamlessly on mobile devices
5. **Real-time Data Synchronization**: Sleep data needs to sync reliably across devices

### Business/Product Challenges:
1. **Regulatory Considerations**: Prediction markets may have legal implications in different jurisdictions
2. **User Onboarding**: Complex feature set requires careful UX design
3. **Data Privacy**: Health data handling requires strict compliance (HIPAA, GDPR)
4. **Monetization Strategy**: Need to define how the prediction market generates revenue

### Current State Analysis:
- Basic React Native app with onboarding and dashboard screens
- Simple backend integration (localhost:4000)
- Basic sleep data display
- No wearable integration yet
- No prediction market functionality
