# Sol REM - UI v0 Hosting Project

## Background and Motivation
The user has a Next.js application (Sol REM - UI v0) that appears to be a sleep tracking/prediction market application with features like leaderboards, markets, and resources. The user wants to host this application so it can be accessed online. The project uses Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19, Tailwind CSS, and various UI components.

## Key Challenges and Analysis
- **Next.js Configuration**: The app has `images: { unoptimized: true }` which suggests it might be configured for static export
- **Dependencies**: Modern stack with React 19 and Next.js 15.2.4 - need to ensure hosting platform supports these versions
- **Static vs Dynamic**: Need to determine if this should be deployed as a static site or as a full Next.js application
- **Environment Setup**: May need environment variables or configuration for production
- **Build Process**: Need to ensure the build works correctly before deployment

## High-level Task Breakdown
1. **Analyze Project Structure** - Understand the app's requirements and configuration
2. **Choose Hosting Platform** - Select appropriate hosting solution (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
3. **Prepare for Deployment** - Ensure build works, check for any production-specific needs
4. **Deploy Application** - Set up hosting and deploy the application
5. **Verify Deployment** - Test the hosted application and ensure all features work

## Project Status Board
- [ ] Analyze project structure and requirements
- [ ] Choose hosting platform
- [ ] Test local build process
- [ ] Deploy application
- [ ] Verify deployment and functionality

## Current Status / Progress Tracking
✅ **Dependencies Installed**: Successfully installed all project dependencies using npm with --legacy-peer-deps flag to resolve React 19 compatibility issues
✅ **Security Fixed**: Updated Next.js from 15.2.4 to 15.5.4 to address moderate security vulnerabilities
✅ **Build Tested**: Application builds successfully with some warnings about viewport metadata configuration
✅ **Dev Server Running**: Development server successfully started and is accessible at:
- **Local**: http://localhost:3000
- **Network**: http://192.168.0.15:3000

## Executor's Feedback or Assistance Requests
None at this time.

## Lessons
- Next.js 15.2.4 with React 19 is a very recent stack - ensure hosting platform supports these versions
- The `images: { unoptimized: true }` configuration suggests this might be intended for static export
